The Apache ORC Project Management Committee (PMC) is happy to announce
that Yiqun Zhang has joined us as a new member of the PMC.
Yiqun has been showing consistent contributions as a committer,
and participated in both major and maintenance releases by actively
helping the release managers with testing the release candidates.

Please welcome Yiqun to the ORC PMC!
